# About Dataset

## ðŸ“„ Dataset Description

This dataset captures the structure, style, and goals of personalized workout programs. It includes key attributes such as program length, time per workout, goal type, equipment used, fitness level, and total number of exercises. The dataset is designed to help analyze patterns in workout preferences and to build machine learning models that predict fitness goals or recommend programs based on user needs.

It is ideal for use in:

*   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*   Classification and regression tasks
*   Recommendation systems for fitness platforms
*   Model interpretability and feature importance projects
*   Neural network and deep learning exercises in health/fitness domains

### Column Descriptions

| Column Name       | Description                                                              |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Program_Length`  | Total length of the workout program (in weeks).                          |
| `Time_Per_Workout`| Average time spent per workout session (in minutes).                     |
| `Level`           | User experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).                |
| `Goal`            | Main fitness goal (Fat Loss, Muscle Gain, Endurance, Flexibility).       |
| `Equipment`       | Type of equipment required (Bodyweight, Dumbbells, Resistance Bands, etc.).|
| `Total_Exercises` | Number of different exercises included in the workout plan.              |

## âœ… Example Use Cases

*   Predicting user fitness goals from workout structure.
*   Recommending optimal workout plans.
*   Evaluating feature importance for training outcome prediction.
*   EDA projects to visualize trends in fitness preferences.
